Ateryx Autopilot (Version 2.5)
------------------------------

The Ateryx Autopilot was designed for the United States Naval Academy Aerospace program in 2008.  It served as a versatile open source autopilot for the university to implement and flight test new flight control algorithms (Energy Height control) and adaptive flight path navigation.

Hardware was designed in Altium and based on analogue gyros and accelerometers because that was all that was available at the time.  These mems sensors were quickly replaced with MPU9000 Series etc.
